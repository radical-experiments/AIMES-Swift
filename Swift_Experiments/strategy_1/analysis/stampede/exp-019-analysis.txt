- TTC : total time to completion of the whole session.
- Tss : Time taken by Swift to set up each task for execution. Can be used
        to determine the percentage of TTC spent on interpreting the given
        swift script. In our experiments this is very short.
- Tse : Time taken to execute each task as logged by Swift. It can be
        compared to the executing time recorded by Coaster for
        sanity/consistency check purposes. Did the sanity check, seems fine.
- Tw  : Time taken by Coaster to schedule a block (i.e., job) on the local
        LRMS + block queuing time of that block. Equivalent to AIMES Tw
- Te  : Time taken by Coaster to execute each task on a worker (i.e.,
        agent). Includes staging in and out timings. Equivalent to AIMES Te.
- Tsi : Time taken by Coaster to stage the task's input file(s) if any.
        Useful if we will decide to include data-related timings in the
        paper.
- Tso : Time taken by Coaster to stage the task's output file(s).  Useful to
        measure Coaster's overhead in saving out/err files after task
        execution.
- Tq  : Time spent by each Block, i.e. pilot, in the resource's queue.
        NOTE: All the time stamps recording by RemoteLogHandler may be
        inaccurate.
- Ta  : Time spent by each block, i.e. pilot, executing. NOTE: All the
        time stamps recording by RemoteLogHandler may be inaccurate. This
        needs further verification.
- Tb  : Time required by the worker, i.e. agent, to bootstrap. NOTE:
        This timing is NOT accurate.
- Twe : Time spent by each worker, i.e, agent, executing. NOTE: All
        the time stamps recording by RemoteLogHandler may be inaccurate.
        This needs further verification.
