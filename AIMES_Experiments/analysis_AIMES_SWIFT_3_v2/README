This folder contains experiments that measure the performance of AIMES
by running 16 jobs (TASKS x MACHINES, where CORES = [8, 32, 256, 2048],
and MACHINES = [Stampede])

CORES = [1], Iterations = range(1, 5)

This experiment is slightly different as we have updated the experiment
script as we were encountering some problems regarding the AWS server
which were using to host our MongoDB server. Thus, we have moved to
using the package aimes.emgr. No other changes has been made to this
experiment script; they do not affect the queue time, run time, nor
the staging time of the files in the script.
