This folder contains experiments that measure the performance of AIMES
by running 16 jobs (TASKS x MACHINES, where CORES = [8, 32, 256, 2048],
and MACHINES = [Stampede, Gordon])

CORES = [1], Iterations = range(1, 5)

There are two folders containing raw data: raw_data_unc100 and
raw_data_TG-MCB090174

There are two folders containing raw data: raw_data_unc100 and
raw_data_TG-MCB090174. Both folders contain the same experiment,
but the only difference is that the ALLOCATION_ID for the machine
Gordron.

The unc100 allocation expired and thus all pilots were force to
run on Stampede. The TG-MCB090174 allocation is used to allow pilots
to run on Gordon. Seven of the pilots submitted on the former
allocation ran to completion, eight were canceled and the experiment
was canceled before the last pilot was able to run in light of the 
new allocation
