This folder contains experiments that measure the performance of AIMES
by running 16 jobs (TASKS x MACHINES, where CORES = [8, 32, 256, 2048],
and MACHINES = [Stampede])

CORES = [1], Iterations = range(1, 5)

There is one experiment failure that is noteworthy:

The 3rd iteration of 256 cores, late-uniform was run again. Though it
was properly executing, there was no Output Staging, indicating that
the experiment did not execute properly.
